# LogUI Server <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl"><img align="right" width="100" src="./.meta/tudelft.svg" /></a>

**Note to ECIR reviewers:** We are in the process of refactoring the LogUI code, incorporating the final features as presented in the demonstration paper you are reading. This is a new repository in which the server code will be shortly placed. In a few weeks' time, implementation of a beta version will be complete. Implementing a framework of this complexity takes time to get right, and we're sure you'll find the end result beneficial for the community. (2020-10-30)

*LogUI* is a powerful, framework-agnostic client-side JavaScript library that can be used for logging interactions that take place on a webpage. Primarily designed for *Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)* experiments, LogUI can in theory be used on any page or site that you wish to track fine-grained user interactions with UI components.

This is the LogUI server repository. You can use this server in tandem with the LogUI JavaScript client library, available at [this repository](https://github.com/maxwelld90/logui-client/).

## About LogUI

The LogUI library is implemented by [David Maxwell](https://github.com/maxwelld90/), a postdoctoral researcher at [TUDelft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the Netherlands. The library is borne out of the need for infrastructure that allows one to undertake the logging of user interactions in a consistent way, rather than the piecemeal approach that we've seen in IIR experimentation.

We think that a one-size-fits-all logging library is just the ticket for your experiments!

## Installing and Building LogUI

To be completed.
